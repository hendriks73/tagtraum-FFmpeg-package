{"name":"tagtraum FFmpeg package","tagline":"FFmpeg with support for javax.sound.sampled in mind","body":"# Welcome!\r\n\r\nThe _tagtraum FFmpeg package_ is a binary release of some of the libraries released by\r\nthe [FFmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/) project. Its purpose is to provide easy access\r\nto Windows and OS X binaries and sources for decoding audio via a\r\n[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) repository.\r\n\r\nThus it serves as an upstream project for Java JNI projects wishing to interface\r\nwith the native libraries like [FFSampledSP](http://www.tagtraum.com/ffsampledsp/).\r\nCodecs with known patent problems are disabled. However, this obviously is no guarantee.\r\n\r\nAlso, as the focus lies on decoding audio, most encoders are disabled.\r\n\r\nThis distribution comes with absolutely no support, warranty etc. you name it.\r\n\r\n## Homepage\r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit [http://www.tagtraum.com/ffmpeg/](http://www.tagtraum.com/ffmpeg/).","google":"UA-7561371-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
